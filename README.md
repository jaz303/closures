# Closures

A very simple implementation of upval-based closures for a register VM. The theory and algorithms are all due to Lua but the implementation is independent.

Written in Javascript as this code is ultimately going to find its way into [Jester](http://github.com/jaz303/jester), but should be easily portable to C.

## TODO

  - <del>fix argument passing for function calls</del>
  - <del>function calls working (without closures)</del>
  - <del>closures working (get upval)</del>
  - closures working (set upval)
  - nested closures working
